# Raylib Dev Container with noVNC

This repository demonstrates using a dev container to develop C++ apps using the raylib library.

The application is compiled as normal. The [light-weight desktop](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/desktop-lite) (desktop-lite) dev container feature is used to allow development of GUI applications. It provides a web-based VNC viewer to view and interact with the GUI application being developed.
